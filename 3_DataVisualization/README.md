# DATA VISUALIZATION

## NumPy Module

NumPy is a Python package which stands for ‘Numerical Python’. It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object, provide tools for integrating C, C++ etc. It is also useful in linear algebra, random number capability etc. NumPy array can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container for generic data.

### => Python NumPy Array v/s List
We use python numpy array instead of a list because of the below three reasons:

1. Less Memory
2. Fast
3. Convenient

The very first reason to choose python numpy array is that it occupies less memory as compared to list. Then, it is pretty fast in terms of execution and at the same time it is very convenient to work with numpy. So these are the major advantages that python numpy array has over list.



## Matplotlib.pyplot

`matplotlib.pyplot` is a plotting library used for 2D graphics in python programming language. It can be used in python scripts, shell, web application servers and other graphical user interface toolkits.

## Pandas

The pandas package is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today. The powerful machine learning and glamorous visualization tools may get all the attention, but pandas is the backbone of most data projects.

Pandas has so many uses that it might make sense to list the things it can't do instead of what it can do. This tool is essentially your data’s home. Through pandas, you get acquainted with your data by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing it. For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. 

==> Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:

• Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like
    ->  What's the average, median, max, or min of each column?
    ->  Does column A correlate with column B?
    ->  What does the distribution of data in column C look like?

• Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria

• Visualize the data with help from Matplotlib. Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more.

• Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database
