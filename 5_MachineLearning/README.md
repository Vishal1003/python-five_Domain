## DATA PREPROCESSING :
Data prepocessing refers to manipulating the data to make it suitable for our model.
It includes following tasks :
1. Importing the dataset
2. Adding the missing values.
3. Encoding of some dats (if necessary) i.e Categorical Data.
4. Splitting the Dataset into the Training Set and Testing Set
5. Feature Scaling (if necessary)

`week1.py` includes all the above methods. While the template file includes omvly required methods that we will be using in upcomming sessions
