# WEB SCRAPING

Web scraping is an automated, programmatic process through which data can be constantly 'scraped' off webpages.
Also known as screen scraping or web harvesting, web scraping can provide instant data from any publicly accessible webpage. On some websites, web scraping may be illegal.

To extract data using web scraping with python, you need to follow these basic steps:

1. Find the URL that you want to scrape
2. Inspecting the Page
3. Find the data you want to extract
4. Write the code
5. Run the code and extract the data
6. Store the data in the required format

## SELENIUM WEBDRIVER :
Selenium WebDriver is a web framework that permits you to execute cross-browser tests. This tool is used for automating web-based application testing to verify that it performs expectedly. Selenium WebDriver allows you to choose a programming language of your choice to create test scripts. As discussed earlier, it is an advancement over Selenium RC to overcome a few limitations. Selenium WebDriver is not capable of handling window components, but this drawback can be overcome by using tools like Sikuli, Auto IT, etc.


## BEAUTIFUL SOUP :
Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like screenscraping. Three features make it powerful: 
1. Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and extracting what you need. It doesn't take much code to write an application.

2. Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, unless the document doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't detect one. Then you just have to specify the original encoding.

3. Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, allowing you to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility.

    A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure â€“ often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree.
